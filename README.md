# Aether-Project

## Introduction ##
This project aims to facilitate accessibility between physics experts and simulation coders. Furthermore, one of the greatest hindrances in a globalized world is the interval between different degrees; countless people around the world do not possess the requisite time or resources to engage with the fundamentals of coding, much less to cultivate expertise in the field, making it considerably more challenging to put into action their calculations or theoretical efforts. Therefore, we introduce the ***Aether Project***, an application easy enough for anyone, at any time, to understand and use; and robust enough to be able to ***attach*** any other ***new theory or equation*** into a simulated world.

The github will show all the process of making and enhancing it, with the detalied manual of how will work
